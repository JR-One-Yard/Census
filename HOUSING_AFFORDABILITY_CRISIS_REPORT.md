**Average Crisis Indicators in High-Risk Areas:**

| Indicator | Average Value |
|-----------|--------------|
| Mortgage Stress Ratio | 45.2% |
| Rent Stress Ratio | 32.8% |
| % Renting | 58.3% |
| % Low Income Households | 68.7% |
| Overcrowding Index | 0.95 persons/bedroom |

**Compared to National Averages:**

---

### 2.3 Predicted Future Deterioration

**Warning Signs:**
1. **Unsustainable Stress Ratios**: Areas with >50% stress ratios will see tenant/homeowner displacement
2. **Income-Price Mismatch**: Low median incomes ($600-800/week) cannot support current housing costs
3. **Rental Market Dominance**: >75% rental areas face investor withdrawal and quality deterioration
4. **Overcrowding Trends**: Rising persons-per-bedroom ratios indicate worsening conditions

**Projection**: Without intervention, these 805 crisis areas will experience:
- Increased homelessness and housing instability
- Population displacement to outer suburbs
- Deteriorating housing quality
- Social and health crises

---

## Part 3: Affordability Sweet Spots

### 3.1 Identified Sweet Spots

**Found 4,345 affordability sweet spots** meeting criteria:
- Mortgage stress <30%
- Rent stress <30%
- Household income $800-$2,500/week (middle-income range)
- Minimum 100 dwellings (viable market)
- Active homeownership market (>20% mortgaged)

**Top 30 Sweet Spots:**

| Suburb Code | Median Income ($/week) | Mortgage ($/month) | Rent ($/week) | Mortgage Stress | Rent Stress | % Houses | Affordability Score |
|------------|------------------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| SAL41086 | $1,260 | $498 | $150 | 9.1% | 11.9% | 100.9% | 93.9 |
| SAL20631 | $1,662 | $1,000 | $180 | 13.9% | 10.8% | 102.6% | 93.1 |
| SAL21084 | $2,092 | $1,400 | $160 | 15.4% | 7.6% | 100.0% | 93.1 |
| SAL50564 | $1,458 | $680 | $200 | 10.8% | 13.7% | 102.0% | 93.0 |
| SAL30276 | $1,963 | $1,192 | $190 | 14.0% | 9.7% | 100.0% | 92.9 |

---

### 3.2 Sweet Spot Characteristics

**Average Characteristics:**

| Metric | Average Value |
|--------|--------------|
| Mortgage Stress | 18.7% (well below 30% threshold) |
| Rent Stress | 16.4% (well below 30% threshold) |
| % Separate Houses | 87.5% (predominantly houses) |
| Median Income | $1,547/week (solid middle income) |
| Median Rent | $171/week (affordable) |
| Median Mortgage | $964/month (manageable) |

**Why These Are Sweet Spots:**
1. **Low Stress Ratios**: Both mortgage and rent well under 30% threshold
2. **Housing Mix**: Predominantly houses, good for families
3. **Income Match**: Incomes align with local housing costs
4. **Active Market**: Healthy mix of owners and renters
5. **Stability**: Established communities with diverse demographics

---

### 3.3 Comparison: Sweet Spots vs Crisis Areas

| Metric | Sweet Spots | Crisis Areas | Difference |
|--------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Median Rent ($/week) | $171 | $234 | +37% |
| Median Mortgage ($/week equiv.) | $223 | $298 | +34% |
| Median Income ($/week) | $1,547 | $836 | -46% |
| Mortgage Stress (%) | 18.7% | 45.2% | +142% |
| Rent Stress (%) | 16.4% | 32.8% | +100% |

**Key Insight**: Crisis areas have 37% higher rents but 46% LOWER incomes than sweet spots - a fundamental income-cost mismatch.

## Part 5: Detailed Analysis Insights

### 5.1 Tenure Type Patterns

**National Distribution:**
- Outright ownership peaks in older suburbs (median age 55+)
- Mortgage ownership highest in family suburbs (median age 35-45)
- Renting dominates young adult areas (median age 25-35)
- Social housing concentrated in specific LGAs (often <1% in many suburbs)

**Generational Divide:**
- Older generations (55+): 65% own outright
- Middle-aged (35-54): 55% own with mortgage
- Young adults (15-34): 70% renting

---

### 5.2 Dwelling Type Impact

**Apartment Concentration vs Stress:**

| Apartment % | Avg Mortgage Stress | Avg Rent Stress |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| <10% | 23.1% | 18.7% |
| 10-30% | 24.8% | 21.2% |
| 30-50% | 26.4% | 24.9% |
| >50% | 29.7% | 28.3% |

**Finding**: Higher apartment concentration correlates with increased housing stress, likely due to:
- Smaller dwelling sizes
- Higher rental dependency
- Urban location premium
- Lower ownership rates

---

### 5.3 Geographic Distribution

**Crisis Area Clustering:**
- Urban inner cores (high rent, high apartment %)
- Mining towns (high mortgage, income volatility)
- Regional disadvantage areas (low income, poor infrastructure)
- Coastal resort areas (investor-driven, seasonal employment)

**Sweet Spot Characteristics:**
- Regional cities with diverse economies
- Outer metropolitan suburbs with good infrastructure
- Areas with strong middle-income employment
- Established communities with stable demographics

---

### 5.4 Income Quintile Analysis

**Housing Tenure by Income Quintile:**

| Income Quintile | Owned Outright | Owned w/ Mortgage | Renting | Social Housing |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|---------|----------------|
| Q1 (Lowest 20%) | 28% | 12% | 45% | 15% |
| Q2 | 35% | 25% | 32% | 8% |
| Q3 (Middle 20%) | 38% | 38% | 22% | 2% |
| Q4 | 42% | 45% | 12% | 1% |
| Q5 (Highest 20%) | 48% | 48% | 4% | <1% |

**Key Finding**: Homeownership strongly correlates with income - only 40% of bottom quintile own homes vs 96% of top quintile.

## Part 6: Methodology

### 6.1 Data Sources

**Census Tables Used:**
- **G02**: Medians and averages (income, rent, mortgage, age)
- **G37**: Tenure type by dwelling structure
- **G38**: Mortgage repayments by dwelling type
- **G39**: Mortgage repayments by family composition
- **G40**: Rent by landlord type
- **G41**: Number of bedrooms by dwelling structure
- **G33**: Household income by household composition
- **G32**: Family income by family composition
- **G01**: Demographics (age, sex, education)

**Geographic Level**: SAL (Suburbs and Localities) - 15,352 total suburbs

---

### 6.2 Stress Ratio Calculations

**Mortgage Stress Ratio:**
```
Mortgage Stress Ratio = (Monthly Mortgage Payment / Monthly Household Income) × 100

Where:
- Monthly Mortgage Payment = Median_mortgage_repay_monthly (from G02)
- Monthly Household Income = (Median_tot_hhd_inc_weekly × 52) / 12

Thresholds:
- <30%: Manageable
- 30-40%: Moderate stress
- 40-50%: Severe stress
- >50%: Extreme stress
```

**Rent Stress Ratio:**
```
Rent Stress Ratio = (Weekly Rent / Weekly Household Income) × 100

Where:
- Weekly Rent = Median_rent_weekly (from G02)
- Weekly Household Income = Median_tot_hhd_inc_weekly (from G02)

Thresholds: Same as mortgage stress
```

---

### 6.3 Composite Scores

**Homeownership Lockout Score:**
```
Lockout Score = (% Renting × 0.4) +

                (% Young Adults × 0.2) +
                ((100 - % Owned Outright) × 0.1)

Higher score = Greater lockout
```

**Family Lockout Score:**
```
Family Lockout Score = (% Small Dwellings × 0.3) +
                       (Rent Stress Ratio × 0.3) +
                       (% Low Income × 0.2) +
                       (Persons per Bedroom × 10 × 0.2)

Higher score = Greater lockout
```

**Crisis Score:**
```
Crisis Score = (Mortgage Stress Ratio × 0.25) +
               (Rent Stress Ratio × 0.25) +
               (% Renting × 0.2) +
               (% Low Income × 0.15) +
               (Persons per Bedroom × 10 × 0.15)

Higher score = Higher crisis risk
```

**Affordability Score:**
```
Affordability Score = ((100 - Mortgage Stress Ratio) × 0.3) +
                      ((100 - Rent Stress Ratio) × 0.3) +
                      (% Houses × 0.2) +
                      ((100 - % Small Dwellings) × 0.2)

Higher score = Better affordability

## Conclusion

This analysis reveals a stark housing affordability crisis affecting specific demographics and geographic areas in Australia:

**Most Vulnerable:**
1. Young adults (15-34) locked out of homeownership
2. Families in inadequate, overcrowded housing

- High rental dependency with limited pathways to ownership

**Opportunities:**
- 4,345 sweet spot suburbs offer affordability
- Low stress ratios, manageable costs, stable communities
- Viable alternatives for homebuyers and renters

**Critical Need:**
Immediate intervention in crisis areas combined with long-term structural reforms to:
