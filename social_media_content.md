   Australia's aging crisis

#AustraliaHousing #Sydney #Millennials
```

### Slide 2: The Aging Problem
```
📊 AUSTRALIA IS GETTING OLD

2021 Census Data:

👶 Children (0-14): 18.2%
💼 Working Age (15-64): 64.6%
👴 Retirees (65+): 17.2%

The dependency ratio:
26.7 retirees per
100 workers

By 2040: 40-45 per 100
(That's a 70% increase!)
```

### Slide 3: What It Means
```
💸 MORE RETIREES =
    HIGHER TAXES FOR YOU

What changes by 2040:
✗ Higher income tax
✗ Expensive healthcare
✗ Strained aged care
✗ Reduced services
✗ Infrastructure pressure

You'll be 50-55 when
this hits hardest 😬
```

### Slide 4: Sydney Housing
```
🏠 SYDNEY HOUSING CRISIS

Median price-to-income ratio:
10-13x

What this means:
$110k family income
= $1.1M-1.4M house

"Severely unaffordable"
is defined as 5.1x

Sydney is 2x worse
than "severely unaffordable"
```

### Slide 5: Your Income Potential
```
💰 CAN YOU OUT-EARN IT?

Ages 35-44 Income Data:

5.5% earn $182k+/year
13.8% earn $104k-156k/year
27.8% earn $52k-91k/year

Top 25% = $104k+
This makes Sydney doable

But you need a plan
to get there →
```

### Slide 6: The Strategy
```
📈 3-PHASE WEALTH PLAN

PHASE 1 (Ages 35-37)
→ Get $100k+ job
→ Save 30-40% income
→ Build $100k-150k capital

PHASE 2 (Ages 37-40)
→ Start side business
→ Keep job for stability
→ Validate business model

PHASE 3 (Age 40+)
→ Full-time business OR
→ Senior employment
→ $150k-250k income
```

### Slide 7: Stay or Leave?
```
🤔 THE 5-YEAR TEST

Stay in Australia IF:
✓ Net worth: $300k-500k
✓ Income: $150k-250k
✓ Housing: Path to ownership

Leave Australia IF:
✗ Struggling financially
✗ Better opportunities abroad
✗ Can't hit wealth targets

Decide by age 40-42
(Kids still young enough
to adapt)
```

### Slide 8: Where to Go?
```
🌍 BEST ALTERNATIVES

FOR INCOME:
• USA (tech hubs)
• UAE (tax-free)
• Singapore (Asia gateway)

FOR AFFORDABILITY:
• Regional Australia first
• Portugal/Spain (EU)
• Southeast Asia (remote)

FOR DEMOGRAPHICS:
• USA (younger)
• Southeast Asia (growing)
```

### Slide 9: Action Steps

   30-40% savings rate)

Should you leave Australia? A data-driven analysis 📊

I analyzed the 2021 Census data to answer a question many millennial families are asking.

The findings surprised me:

🔴 THE PROBLEM:
• 26.7 retirees per 100 workers (2021)
• Projected 40-45 per 100 by 2040
• Sydney house price-to-income: 10-13x
• "Severely unaffordable" is 5.1x

You're looking at significantly higher taxes and strained public services by the time you're 50.

🟢 THE OPPORTUNITY:
• 22.7% of ages 35-44 earn $104k+/year
• Top 25% income makes Sydney manageable
• Geographic arbitrage creates wealth faster
• You have 5 years to decide strategically

📊 KEY INSIGHT:
The aging crisis plays out over 15-20 years, not overnight. You have time to build wealth and create options.

💡 MY RECOMMENDATION:
Give yourself 5 years to hit these targets:
→ Net worth: $300k-500k
→ Household income: $150k-250k
→ Clear path to housing

Hit the targets? Staying is viable.
Miss the targets? Seriously evaluate relocation.

The three-phase approach:
1. Ages 35-37: High-paying employment, aggressive saving
2. Ages 37-40: Side business while employed
3. Age 40+: Scale business or senior career

🎯 BOTTOM LINE:
Whether you stay or leave Australia, make it a choice based on data—not desperation.

Full analysis based on 2021 Australian Census data (G02, G04, G17 tables).

What's your take? Staying or exploring options abroad?

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
Should you leave Australia?

I analyzed the 2021 Census data to find out.

The answer surprised me 🧵

(Data every millennial parent needs to see)
```

### Tweet 2
```
First, the uncomfortable truth:

Australia is aging FAST.

Current: 26.7 retirees per 100 workers
2040: 40-45 per 100 workers

That's a 70% increase.

If you're 35 now, you'll be 50 when this hits hardest.

More retirees = higher taxes for YOU.
```

### Tweet 3
```
Add Sydney's housing crisis:

Median price-to-income ratio: 10-13x
"Severely unaffordable": 5.1x

Sydney is 2x worse than "severely unaffordable"

If you earn $110k (median family income):
Median house costs $1.1M-1.4M

That's 10-13 years of gross income 😬
```

### Tweet 4
```
But here's what the data also shows:

22.7% of ages 35-44 earn $104k+/year
5.5% earn $182k+/year

You're in PEAK EARNING YEARS.

If you can break into top 25% income, Sydney becomes manageable.

The question: How do you get there?
```

### Tweet 5
```
The 3-phase strategy that works:

PHASE 1 (35-37): Get $100k+ job, save 30-40%
PHASE 2 (37-40): Side business while employed
PHASE 3 (40+): Scale business or senior role

Goal: $150k-250k household income by 40

This makes Sydney doable.
```

### Tweet 6
```
The 5-year test:

Target by age 40:
✓ Net worth: $300k-500k
✓ Income: $150k-250k
✓ Housing: Path to ownership

Hit these? Stay in Australia.
Miss these? Seriously consider relocation.

Don't rage-quit. Use data to decide.
```

### Tweet 7
```
If you do leave, best alternatives:

FOR INCOME:
• USA tech hubs (30-50% higher salaries)
• UAE (tax-free income)
• Singapore (Asian gateway)

FOR AFFORDABILITY:
• Regional Australia first
• Portugal/Spain
• Southeast Asia

Test before 45 (kids adapt easier)
```

### Tweet 8
```
Bottom line:

Australia's aging + housing crisis is REAL.

But it's a 15-20 year problem, not immediate.

You have 5 years to:
• Build wealth
• Develop portable skills
• Create options
• Make strategic choice

The next 5 years determine everything.
```

### Tweet 9
```
Action steps THIS WEEK:

1. Calculate your net worth
2. Find your savings rate (target 30-40%)
3. Research salary benchmarks
4. List your top 10 valuable skills

Whether you stay or go, make it a CHOICE.

🇦🇺 Should Your Family Leave Australia? Here's What The Census Data Says

If you're a millennial parent in Sydney, you've probably wondered: "Can we actually afford to stay here?"

I spent weeks analyzing the 2021 Australian Census data to answer this question. What I found will surprise you.

📊 THE HARD TRUTHS:

1. AGING POPULATION
→ Currently 26.7 retirees per 100 workers
→ By 2040: 40-45 per 100 (when you're ~50)
→ This means significantly higher taxes ahead

2. SYDNEY HOUSING
→ Price-to-income ratio: 10-13x
→ "Severely unaffordable" is defined as 5.1x
→ Sydney is TWICE as bad as "severely unaffordable"

3. YOUR EARNING POWER
→ You're aged 35-44 (peak earning years!)
→ 22.7% of your age group earns $104k+/year
→ 5.5% earns $182k+/year

💡 THE STRATEGY:

Don't panic and leave immediately.
Don't blindly commit to staying forever.

Instead, use the 5-YEAR TEST:

TARGET BY AGE 40:
✅ Net worth: $300k-500k
✅ Household income: $150k-250k
✅ Clear path to housing

How to get there:
→ Phase 1 (now-37): High-paying job ($100k+), save 30-40%
→ Phase 2 (37-40): Side business while employed
→ Phase 3 (40+): Scale business OR senior career role

🌍 IF YOU DO LEAVE:

Best alternatives for:
• High income: USA, UAE, Singapore
• Affordability: Regional Australia, Portugal, Southeast Asia
• Demographics: USA, Southeast Asia

Move before 45 if possible (kids adapt easier).

🎯 BOTTOM LINE:

Australia is still one of the best countries in the world.

But the combination of aging population + extreme housing costs creates real challenges.

The good news? You have TIME to build wealth and create options.

Use data to decide. Not emotion. Not desperation.

The next 5 years will determine your family's next 30 years.

TITLE: [OC] I analyzed the 2021 Census data to answer: Should millennial families leave Australia? Here's what I found.

POST:

I'm a data analyst and a millennial parent in Sydney. Like many of you, I've wondered if we can actually afford to stay here long-term.

Instead of doomscrolling property listings at 2am, I decided to analyze the 2021 Australian Census data properly. Here's what 25.4 million data points tell us.

## THE HARD NUMBERS

**Aging Population:**
- Current dependency ratio: 26.7 retirees per 100 workers
- Projected 2040: 40-45 per 100 workers
- That's a 70% increase in fiscal burden
- If you're 35 now, you'll be 50 when this hits hardest

**Sydney Housing:**
- Median price-to-income ratio: 10-13x
- International standard for "severely unaffordable": 5.1x
- Sydney is literally 2x worse than "severely unaffordable"
- Median family income $110k = $1.1M-1.4M median house

**Income Potential (Ages 35-44):**
- Total cohort: 3.49 million people
- 22.7% earn $104k+/year
- 5.5% earn $182k+/year
- Median: ~$52k-$65k/year

## THE ANALYSIS

I built a decision framework based on three scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Stay in Australia**
- Requires: Top 20-30% income ($104k+ individual, $150k-250k household)
- Strategy: Out-earn the housing crisis
- Risk: Aging population increases taxes significantly by 2040
- Best for: Those who can achieve high income and don't mind higher taxes

**Scenario 2: Leave for Better Opportunity**
- Targets: USA (higher salaries), UAE (tax-free), Singapore (Asia gateway)
- Strategy: Geographic arbitrage - earn more, pay less tax
- Risk: Leaving family/network, cultural adjustment
- Best for: Career-focused, willing to relocate for 30-50% income increase

**Scenario 3: Leave for Affordability**
- Targets: Regional Australia first, then Portugal/Spain, Southeast Asia
- Strategy: Lower cost of living, same or remote income
- Risk: Less opportunity, lifestyle changes
- Best for: Those who can work remotely or have portable income

## MY RECOMMENDATION: The 5-Year Test

Don't make an emotional decision. Use data.

**Target metrics by age 40:**
- Net worth: $300k-500k
- Household income: $150k-250k
- Housing: Clear path to ownership OR strategic renting + investing

**If you hit these targets:** Staying in Australia is viable. You've built sufficient wealth to buffer against future tax increases.

**If you don't:** Seriously evaluate relocation. You're 40, kids are ~10-12, still young enough to adapt.

**After age 45:** Window closes (kids enter high school, much harder to move).

## THE 3-PHASE STRATEGY

**Phase 1 (Ages 35-37): Employment**
- Get highest-paying job possible ($100k-150k target)
- Save 30-40% of after-tax income
- Build skills and capital
- Goal: $100k-150k saved in 2-3 years

**Phase 2 (Ages 37-40): Side Hustle**
- Start business while keeping job
- Validate concept with real customers
- Use employment income for stability
- Goal: $30k-50k/year from business

**Phase 3 (Ages 40+): Scale**
- Full-time business OR senior employment
- $150k-300k+ income target
- Reinvest in wealth building
- Goal: $500k-1M net worth by 45

## DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

1. Are you planning to stay or leave? What's your decision framework?
2. What income level do you think makes Sydney viable long-term?
3. Has anyone here actually relocated? How did it work out?
4. Am I too pessimistic or too optimistic about the aging impacts?

Happy to answer questions about the methodology or data.
