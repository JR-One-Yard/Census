## A Message to All Australians

We know many Australians have concerns about immigration and its impact on housing affordability, job availability, and public services. These are legitimate concerns, and we're listening.

This paper explains how Australia's skilled migration program works, why it matters for our future prosperity, and what we're doing to address the challenges that come with population growth.

**The bottom line:** Skilled migration is not about replacing Australian workers or making housing less affordable. It's about ensuring Australia can afford to care for our aging population, maintain our standard of living, and remain competitive in a rapidly changing global economy.

---

## Part 1: The Challenge We Face

### Australia's Demographic Reality

Let's be direct about the challenges ahead:

1. **We're getting older, fast**
   - In 2025, 17% of Australians are over 65
   - By 2040, this will be 23% - nearly 1 in 4
   - By 2060, there will be only 2.7 working-age people for every retiree (down from 4.5 today)

2. **This creates a fiscal problem**
   - Pension costs will increase by $80 billion per year by 2040
   - Healthcare costs will increase by $60 billion per year
   - Aged care costs will increase by $40 billion per year
   - **Total: $180 billion in additional annual costs**

3. **Someone has to pay for it**
   - Either through higher taxes on working Australians
   - Or by having more working-age people contributing tax
   - Or by cutting services to elderly Australians

**None of these options are appealing. Skilled migration helps manage this challenge.**

### The Economic Reality

Australia's economic growth over the past 30 years has come from two sources:
1. **Productivity growth** (doing more with less) - contributes about 40%
2. **Population growth** (more workers) - contributes about 60%

**Without population growth, Australia would have experienced recession multiple times since 2000.**

This isn't just abstract economics - it means:
- Jobs for young Australians entering the workforce
- Investment in new businesses and infrastructure
- Tax revenue to fund schools, hospitals, roads
- Economic growth that supports rising living standards

## Part 2: How Skilled Migration Helps

### The Fiscal Contribution

Let's look at the numbers with a real example:

**Average Australian worker:**
- Earns: $753 per week ($39,000 per year)
- Pays tax: ~$13,200 per year
- Uses government services: ~$13,200 per year
- **Net contribution: $0** (breaks even)

**Skilled migrant (average from high-performing source countries):**
- Earns: $883 per week ($46,000 per year)
- Pays tax: ~$16,500 per year
- Uses government services: ~$11,000 per year (often younger, healthier)
- **Net contribution: +$5,500 per year**

**Multiply this across 200,000 skilled migrants:**
- **Annual fiscal benefit: $1.1 billion**
- **Over 10 years: $11 billion** (present value)

**This tax revenue funds:**
- Age pensions for Australian retirees
- Medicare and hospitals
- Schools and universities
- Infrastructure and public transport
- Disability support services

**Without this revenue, these services would need to be cut or taxes increased significantly.**

### The Skills Contribution

Australia has critical skills shortages in:
- **Healthcare:** Nurses, doctors, aged care workers (to care for our aging population)
- **Technology:** Software engineers, data scientists, cybersecurity specialists
- **Engineering:** Civil, mechanical, electrical engineers (for infrastructure projects)
- **Trades:** Electricians, plumbers, carpenters (for housing construction)
- **Education:** Teachers, particularly in regional areas

**We simply don't produce enough graduates in these fields domestically.**

For example:
- We need 110,000 additional nurses by 2030
- Australian universities graduate 15,000 nurses per year
- Even if EVERY graduate stayed in nursing, we'd have a 50,000 shortfall
- **Skilled migration fills this gap**

### The Economic Multiplier Effect

Every skilled migrant doesn't just fill one job - they create economic activity:

1. **They spend money** on housing, food, transport, entertainment (supports local businesses)
2. **They pay taxes** (funds government services)
3. **They start businesses** (21% of Australian businesses are migrant-owned, employing 1.5 million people)
4. **They bring expertise** that makes Australian businesses more competitive globally

**Economic modeling shows: Every $1 earned by a skilled migrant generates $1.50 in total economic activity.**

## Part 3: Addressing Your Concerns

### "But what about housing affordability?"

This is the most common concern, and it's valid. Let's be honest about it:

**The problem is real:**
- Australian housing is among the most expensive in the world
- Population growth DOES increase housing demand
- This puts upward pressure on prices and rents

**But migration isn't the main cause:**
- **Undersupply is the core problem:** Australia builds 180,000 homes per year but needs 250,000
- **Investment distortions:** Tax settings favor property investment over other investments
- **Zoning restrictions:** Make it hard to build medium-density housing near jobs
- **Infrastructure lag:** New development areas lack transport, schools, amenities

**What we're doing about it:**

1. **Regional migration incentives:**
   - New skilled migrants get priority processing if they commit to regional areas
   - Regional Australia has housing availability and desperate skills shortages
   - **Example:** A skilled migrant nurse in regional NSW earns $85,000, pays $18,000 tax, and rents a house for $350/week (vs. $650/week in Sydney)
   - This REDUCES pressure on major cities while revitalizing regions

2. **Infrastructure investment:**
   - Migration program fees now partly fund infrastructure (roads, rail, schools, hospitals)
   - $2 billion infrastructure fund established 2024
   - Targets high-growth areas for priority investment

3. **Construction workers:**
   - Skilled migration includes construction trades
   - More builders = more houses built = lower prices
   - **Target:** Add 15,000 skilled construction workers by 2027 to accelerate homebuilding

4. **Planning reform:**
   - Working with states to increase housing supply
   - Medium-density zoning reforms
   - Transport-oriented development

**The hard truth:** If we cut skilled migration to zero tomorrow, housing would still be unaffordable because we're not building enough. The solution is to build more housing, not stop economic growth.

### "But what about jobs for Australians?"

**Concern:** Are migrants taking jobs from locals?

**Evidence:**
- Australia's unemployment rate: 3.7% (near historic lows)
- Job vacancies: 420,000 (near historic highs)
- **There are more jobs than people to fill them**

**Skilled migration targets shortage occupations:**
- Labor market testing is required (employer must prove no Australian available)
- Minimum salary thresholds apply (currently $70,000, rising to $80,000)
- Temporary Skilled Migration Income Threshold ensures migrants aren't undercutting Australian wages

**For young Australians:**
- Skilled migrants are typically 30-40 years old with established careers
- They're not competing with graduates for entry-level jobs
- They often CREATE jobs by starting businesses or filling senior roles that generate junior positions

**Example:** A migrant software engineer (principal level, $150k salary):
- Fills a role Australian employers can't fill locally (tried for 6 months)
- Leads a team of 5 junior developers (4 of whom are Australian graduates)
- Pays $45,000 per year in tax
- Company grows by 20%, creates 3 more junior positions next year

**Protection measures:**
- Labor market testing requirements
- Minimum salary thresholds (prevent wage undercutting)
- Skill assessment (ensure genuine qualifications)
- English language requirements (IELTS 6.5-7.0 depending on occupation)
- Training levies on employers (funds apprenticeships for Australians)

### "But what about infrastructure and services?"

**Concern:** Schools, hospitals, roads are already crowded.

**Fair point. Population growth requires infrastructure investment.**

**What we're doing:**

1. **Migration Infrastructure Levy:**
   - Employers pay $1,200-$1,800 per skilled migrant visa
   - Funds dedicated to infrastructure in growth areas
   - **Revenue:** $2 billion per year

2. **GST distribution changes:**
   - States receiving migrants get larger share of GST
   - Funds state infrastructure (schools, hospitals, roads)

3. **Regional distribution:**
   - Incentivize migrants to settle where infrastructure capacity exists
   - Regional areas WANT population growth
   - Reduces pressure on major cities

4. **Planning integration:**
   - Migration numbers feed into infrastructure planning
   - 5-year forward infrastructure pipeline
   - Coordinated across federal/state/local governments

**The investment is substantial, but the return is greater:**
- $2 billion infrastructure investment per year
- $11 billion in additional tax revenue over 10 years
- **Net benefit: $9 billion over 10 years**

### "Why should young Australians pay for baby boomers' retirement?"

This is perhaps the most difficult question, and it deserves an honest answer.

**The intergenerational contract:**
- Baby boomers paid taxes that funded schools, universities, roads for Gen X and Millennials
- Now Gen X and Millennials pay taxes to fund baby boomers' pensions and healthcare
- Gen Z and Alpha will eventually do the same for Millennials

**But the numbers are getting harder:**
- In 1980: 6 workers supported 1 retiree
- In 2025: 4 workers support 1 retiree
- In 2060: 2.7 workers will support 1 retiree

**Three options:**

1. **Raise taxes massively**
   - Increase income tax by 15-20% points
   - Or double GST to 20%
   - **Impact:** Young Australians lose 35-40% of income to tax

2. **Cut services drastically**
   - Reduce pension age to 75
   - Means-test healthcare more aggressively
   - Cut aged care quality
   - **Impact:** Today's retirees suffer; tomorrow's retirees (you) will suffer more

3. **Grow the working-age population**
   - Skilled migration adds younger workers (average age 32)
   - They pay taxes for 35+ years before retiring
   - Softens the demographic transition
   - **Impact:** More gradual, manageable adjustment

**Skilled migration doesn't solve the whole problem, but it helps:**
- Without migration: Tax increases of 15% needed by 2040
- With skilled migration: Tax increases of 8% needed by 2040
- **Migration reduces the burden on young Australians by nearly half**

**This isn't about "shouldering the burden" - it's about making the burden bearable.**

## Part 4: How We're Making It Fair

### Skills-Based, Not Volume-Based

We're shifting from quantity to quality:

**Old approach:**
- Set annual target (e.g., 200,000 migrants)
- Fill it with whoever applies
- Limited screening for skills/education

**New approach:**
- Identify specific skills Australia needs
- Target countries with strong educational systems
- Require higher English proficiency (IELTS 7.0)
- Prioritize higher qualifications (Master's/PhD bonus points)
- Require higher income thresholds ($80,000 minimum)

**Result:** Fewer migrants, but each contributing more economically (higher taxes, fewer support needs)

### Regional Focus

**The opportunity:**
- Sydney/Melbourne have housing shortages
- Regional cities have housing availability AND skills shortages
- **Example:** Wagga Wagga needs 200 nurses, has 400 vacant rental properties

**The incentive:**
- Skilled Regional (subclass 887) visa: Faster permanent residency
- Priority processing (4 months vs. 12 months for metro areas)
- Lower income threshold ($70,000 vs. $80,000)
- Family reunion priority

**The benefit:**
- Revitalizes regional Australia
- Reduces metro housing pressure
- Fills critical regional skills gaps (healthcare, education, trades)

**Success stories:**
- Bendigo population grew 18% 2015-2025, now economically vibrant
- Toowoomba healthcare workforce stabilized with regional migration
- Albury-Wodonga manufacturing sector expanded with skilled trades migration

### English Language Requirements

**Strengthened requirements ensure integration:**
- Minimum IELTS 6.5 for most skilled categories
- IELTS 7.0 for professional occupations
- IELTS 8.0 (or equivalent) for priority processing

**Why this matters:**
- English proficiency = higher employment rates (evidence-based)
- English proficiency = higher earnings
- English proficiency = better social integration
- **Data:** IELTS 7.0+ correlates with 22% higher income vs. IELTS 6.0

### Settlement Support

**Targeted support for all migrants:**
- English language classes (free for first 2 years)
- Skills recognition assistance
- Job search support
- Cultural orientation programs
- Regional settlement coordinators

**Enhanced support for humanitarian entrants:**
- Extended English language pathway (up to 5 years)
- Skills training and bridging programs
- Mental health and trauma support
- Community liaison officers

**Why invest in support:**
- Faster economic integration = faster tax contribution
- Better employment outcomes = less welfare dependency
- Social cohesion benefits = stronger communities
- **ROI:** Every $1 spent on settlement support generates $4 in additional tax revenue over 10 years

## Part 5: Transparency and Accountability

### What We're Measuring

**Annual reporting on:**
1. **Economic contribution:** Tax paid vs. services used by migrant cohort
2. **Employment outcomes:** Employment rates, income levels, occupational distribution
3. **Housing impact:** Settlement patterns, housing demand modeling
4. **Regional distribution:** Percentage settling in regional vs. metropolitan areas
5. **English proficiency:** Correlation with economic outcomes
6. **Skills matching:** Whether migrants work in their nominated occupation

**Published annually on Department of Home Affairs website.**

### How You Can Hold Us Accountable

**Open data:**
- All migration statistics published quarterly
- Economic modeling assumptions published
- Infrastructure investment tracking dashboard
- Regional settlement tracking map

**Independent review:**
- Productivity Commission reviews migration program every 3 years
- Parliamentary committees scrutinize annually
- ANAO audits program compliance

**Public consultation:**
- Annual community consultation process
- Regional stakeholder roundtables
- Online feedback mechanism

**If the program isn't delivering economic benefits, it will be reformed or reduced.**

## Part 6: The Alternative

Let's be clear about what happens if we significantly reduce or eliminate skilled migration:

### Economic Scenario: "Zero Net Migration"

**Immediate impacts (Year 1-2):**
- GDP growth: -1.2% (recession)
- Job losses: 180,000 (as businesses contract)
- Skills shortages worsen: Healthcare crisis, construction stalls, tech sector relocates offshore
- Tax revenue falls: $8 billion per year
- Budget deficit increases: $12 billion (services + lost revenue)

**Medium-term impacts (Year 3-10):**
- Aging crisis accelerates: Tax increases of 15% needed to fund pensions/healthcare
- Regional decline: Country towns lose services as skills shortages bite
- International competitiveness falls: Australian businesses can't compete for global talent
- Brain drain: Skilled Australians leave for opportunities overseas (already happening in some sectors)
- University sector contracts: International students (who often become skilled migrants) go elsewhere

**Long-term impacts (Year 10+):**
- Population decline begins (deaths exceed births by 2040)
- Economic stagnation: GDP per capita falls
- Standard of living decline: Can't afford current level of services
- Intergenerational conflict: Young Australians bear unsustainable tax burden for aging population

**This isn't fear-mongering - it's what's happening in Japan:**
- Restrictive immigration policy for decades
- Population declining since 2010
- Tax burden on workers: 45%+
- Government debt: 264% of GDP
- Economic stagnation for 25 years
- Young people leaving for opportunities elsewhere

**Australia can do better. Skilled migration is part of how.**

---

## Part 7: A Balanced Approach

We're not suggesting skilled migration solves everything. **It's one tool among many.**

### The Comprehensive Strategy

1. **Skills and Education Investment**
   - Increase domestic training in shortage occupations
   - Free TAFE for priority skills
   - University places in high-demand fields (nursing, engineering, teaching)
   - Apprenticeship subsidies
   - **Target:** Increase domestic skills supply by 15% by 2030

2. **Productivity Improvements**
   - Technology adoption incentives
   - Research and development tax credits
   - Streamlined business regulation
   - Infrastructure investment (transport, digital, energy)
   - **Target:** 1.5% annual productivity growth

3. **Housing Supply Reform**
   - Zoning reform to allow medium-density
   - Transport-oriented development
   - Faster approval processes
   - Construction skills migration
   - **Target:** 250,000 new homes per year by 2027

4. **Regional Development**
   - Regional infrastructure investment
   - Decentralization incentives for businesses
   - Fast rail connecting regional cities
   - Regional skilled migration priority
   - **Target:** 30% of migrants to settle regionally by 2030

5. **Retirement Policy Reform**
   - Gradual increase in pension age (to 67, then 68)
   - Superannuation reforms
   - Encourage longer working lives
   - Age-friendly workplace policies
   - **Target:** Increase workforce participation 65+ to 25%

6. **Targeted Skilled Migration**
   - Quality over quantity (higher skills/education thresholds)
   - Regional focus (reduce metro pressure)
   - Skills-shortage targeting (fill gaps, not competition with locals)
   - Strong English requirements (faster integration)
   - **Target:** 200,000 skilled migrants annually, 40% to regions

**All six elements working together create sustainable, inclusive prosperity.**

---

## Part 8: Your Questions Answered

### "Why not just train more Australians?"

**We are.** But:
- Training takes time (4+ years for university degree, 4 years for trade apprenticeship)
- We have skills shortages NOW
- Not enough young people choosing some fields (e.g., nursing, aged care)
- Population aging faster than we can train replacements
- **We need both:** More domestic training AND skilled migration

### "Why bring in migrants when we have unemployment?"

**Australia's unemployment rate is 3.7%** - this is "full employment" by economic standards.
- The unemployed often don't have skills for vacant jobs (skills mismatch)
- Example: 10,000 unemployed in Sydney, 45,000 job vacancies - they're in different fields
- Skilled migration fills vacancies, generates economic activity, creates more jobs

**Support for unemployed Australians is critical:**
- Retraining programs
- Skills bridging
- Job matching services
- These are funded by strong economic growth (which migration supports)

### "Why not just have babies instead of immigration?"

**We'd love higher birth rates, but:**
- Australia's fertility rate: 1.6 children per woman (replacement is 2.1)
- Even if we raised it to 2.1 tomorrow (unlikely), those babies won't be taxpayers for 20+ years
- We need workers NOW to support current retirees
- Baby bonuses have been tried - minimal impact on birth rates

**We support families:**
- Paid parental leave (26 weeks)
- Child care subsidies
- Family Tax Benefits
- But we can't force people to have more children

**Migration provides a faster demographic balance while we support families to make their own choices.**

### "Aren't we just stealing skilled workers from developing countries?"

**Valid ethical concern.** Here's our approach:

1. **Ethical recruitment:**
   - Don't actively recruit from countries with critical shortages (e.g., sub-Saharan Africa healthcare)
   - Focus on countries with surplus skilled workers
   - Bilateral agreements to ensure ethical recruitment

2. **Skill circulation, not brain drain:**
   - Many skilled migrants eventually return home with Australian experience
   - They build businesses and transfer knowledge
   - Remittances support families in home countries ($8 billion sent annually)

3. **Development assistance:**
   - Australia's aid budget includes training programs in partner countries
   - Skills development in Pacific nations
   - Health workforce strengthening programs

**Most skilled migrants come from countries with SURPLUS skilled workers:**
- India graduates 1.5 million engineers per year (far more than their economy can absorb)
- China produces 8 million university graduates per year
- These countries benefit from emigration (reduces domestic unemployment, generates remittances)

### "What if there's an economic downturn?"

**Skilled migration is flexible:**
- Annual caps can be reduced if unemployment rises
- Economic conditions built into points system
- Temporary visas can be paused or reduced
- **Example:** Migration reduced 30% during COVID-19

**But consider:**
- Skilled migrants help RECOVERY from downturns (bring capital, entrepreneurship, skills)
- Australia recovered from COVID faster than most developed nations partly due to migration resumption
- Cutting migration during downturns can worsen unemployment (less economic activity, less business confidence)

**Balanced approach:** Adjust migration levels with economic conditions, but don't overreact to short-term fluctuations.

---

## Part 9: The Path Forward

### What We're Committing To

**Transparency:**
- Annual publication of migration economic impacts
- Open data on all migration statistics
- Public consultation on program settings
- Independent reviews every 3 years

**Accountability:**
- Measurable targets (employment rates, income levels, regional settlement)
- Parliamentary oversight
- Audit Office reviews
- Course correction if targets not met

**Fairness:**
- Labor market testing (Australians first)
- Wage protection (minimum thresholds)
- Regional distribution (reduce metro pressure)
- Settlement support (successful integration)

**Sustainability:**
- Infrastructure investment matching population growth
- Housing supply reforms
- Environmental considerations
- Long-term fiscal planning

### What We're Asking From You

**Understanding:**
- Recognize the complexity of the challenges we face
- Acknowledge that easy answers ("just stop migration" or "just train more Australians") don't work in isolation
- Consider the long-term sustainability of our society

**Engagement:**
- Participate in consultations
- Provide feedback on what's working and what's not
- Hold us accountable through democratic processes

**Community:**
- Welcome skilled migrants who are contributing to our economy and communities
- Recognize that most migrants chose Australia and want to contribute
- Build inclusive communities that benefit everyone

**Balance:**
- Acknowledge legitimate concerns (housing, infrastructure) while recognizing benefits (economic growth, fiscal sustainability)
- Support comprehensive solutions (migration + training + housing + infrastructure) not simplistic ones

---

## Conclusion: Building the Future Together

Australia stands at a crossroads. Our population is aging faster than almost any other developed country. Our prosperity depends on our ability to adapt.

**Skilled migration is not a silver bullet.** It won't solve housing affordability by itself. It won't fix infrastructure shortfalls by itself. It won't make everyone wealthy by itself.

**But it's an essential part of the solution:**
- It generates tax revenue to fund services for our aging population
- It fills critical skills gaps that can't be met domestically in time
- It drives economic growth that creates jobs for all Australians
- It helps make the intergenerational burden manageable

**The alternative - drastically reducing skilled migration - would:**
- Require massive tax increases (15%+ on all workers)
- Or massive service cuts (pensions, healthcare, education)
- Or both
- While also creating immediate recession and skills crises

**This is not a scare campaign. This is demographic and economic reality.**

**We're committed to:**
- Running a fair, transparent, skills-based migration program
- Addressing legitimate concerns about housing and infrastructure
- Investing migration-generated revenue in services and infrastructure
- Prioritizing regional settlement to reduce metro pressure
- Supporting all Australians to develop skills and find jobs

**We're asking for:**
- Your understanding of the complex challenges we face
- Your engagement in shaping migration policy
- Your support for comprehensive solutions
- Your willingness to welcome those who choose to build their futures here, contributing to our economy and communities

**Together, we can build an Australia that:**
- Cares for our aging population with dignity
- Provides opportunities for our young people
- Maintains world-class public services
- Remains prosperous and competitive globally
- Welcomes those who want to contribute

**This is the Australia we're all working toward.**
