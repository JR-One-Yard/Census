   - Areas with recent rapid growth in specific demographics
   - Higher growth potential but more volatile
   - Early investment opportunities before full establishment

   AFFORDABILITY PATTERNS:

   FOR DEVELOPERS:
   a) Design culturally appropriate housing (size, layout)
   b) Focus on areas with projected population growth
   c) Consider multi-generational housing in established communities
   d) Plan for evolving demographic needs

   FOR URBAN PLANNERS:
