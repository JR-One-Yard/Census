## 2026 Scenario Projections

### Business as Usual
*Current trends continue*

- Rent Growth: 20%
- Income Growth: 12%
- Public Housing Change: +0%

**Change from 2021**: +2,970 (+52.3%)

### Crisis Scenario
*Affordability crisis worsens*

- Rent Growth: 30%
- Income Growth: 8%
- Public Housing Change: -5%

**Projected Stressed SA1s (2026)**: 16,791
**Change from 2021**: +11,115 (+195.8%)

### Policy Intervention
*Strong policy response*

- Rent Growth: 15%
- Income Growth: 15%
- Public Housing Change: +25%

**Projected Stressed SA1s (2026)**: 5,672

## Policy Implications

### Without Intervention (Business as Usual)
- **2,970 additional SA1s** will enter rental stress by 2026
- Affordability crisis continues to deepen
- Low-income households face increasing displacement risk

### With Strong Policy Response
- Rental stress can be **4 SA1s lower** than business-as-usual
- Requires coordinated action: rent controls + wage growth + public housing investment
- 25% increase in public housing supply needed over 5 years
