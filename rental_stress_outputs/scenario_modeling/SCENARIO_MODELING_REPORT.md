- Projected Stress Reduction: **351 SA1s**
- Supply Gap Closed: **199.5%**

---

### Scenario 5: Accessibility-Focused ($5B)
*Prioritize areas near employment centers*

**Budget**: $5,000,000,000 ($5.0B)
**Strategy**: accessibility

**Impact Metrics**:
- Dwellings Delivered: **300**

**Budget**: $5,000,000,000 ($5.0B)
**Strategy**: equity

**Impact Metrics**:
- Dwellings Delivered: **8,600**
- SA1 Areas Receiving Investment: **172**

- Cost per Household: **$581,395**
- Projected Stress Reduction: **13 SA1s**
- Supply Gap Closed: **7.4%**

---

## Key Findings

### Best Cost Efficiency
**Scenario 2: Budget-Constrained ($2B)** achieves lowest cost per household at $56,000

### Greatest Impact
**Scenario 4: Major Investment ($13B)** reduces stress in 351 SA1s

### Required Investment for Full Gap Closure
To fully close the supply-demand gap:
- **116,333 dwellings** needed
- **$6,514,648,000** ($6.5B) total investment required

---

## Policy Recommendations

### Short-Term (2-3 years)
- Implement **Scenario 2 or 3** ($2-5B)
- Focus on highest priority areas
- Quick wins to demonstrate effectiveness

### Medium-Term (3-5 years)
- Scale up to **Scenario 4** ($13B)
- Comprehensive gap closure
- Sustainable funding mechanism

### Strategy Optimization
- **Accessibility-focused** strategy maximizes resident outcomes
- Locations near employment reduce transport costs
- **Equity-focused** strategy addresses most vulnerable communities
- Mixed strategy balances efficiency and equity
