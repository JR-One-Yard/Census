### Key Findings

- **Average distance to employment**: 283.5 km
- **Median distance to employment**: 278.2 km
- **Average transport cost**: $200/week
- **Transport as % of income**: 11.3% (average)
- **SA1s with severe combined burden** (housing + transport >50%): **3,816**

---

## Accessibility Distribution

- **Excellent (0-10km)**: 688 SA1s (1.1%)
- **Good (10-20km)**: 398 SA1s (0.6%)
- **Limited (40-60km)**: 3,196 SA1s (5.2%)
- **Moderate (20-40km)**: 2,097 SA1s (3.4%)
- **Poor (>60km)**: 55,465 SA1s (89.7%)

## Transport Poverty Analysis

**Transport poverty** occurs when households spend excessive proportions of income on transport while living in low-accessibility areas.

- **12,358 SA1s** experience transport poverty
- These areas face **both** high transport costs AND poor job access
- Combined with rental stress creates severe affordability crisis

## Policy Implications

### 1. Location Efficiency Matters
Social housing near employment centers provides:
- Lower transport costs for residents
- Better access to job opportunities
- Reduced car dependency and emissions
- Improved social mobility

### 2. Combined Affordability Crisis
**3,816 SA1s** face combined housing + transport burden >50%
- Traditional rent-to-income ratios underestimate true affordability stress
- Must consider **total** living costs, not just rent
- Low-income households in outer suburbs face worst outcomes

### 3. Optimal Investment Strategy
Identified **500 optimal locations** balancing:
- High rental stress (affordability need)
- Good employment accessibility (>40/100 score)
- Public transport connectivity

Investing in these locations maximizes resident outcomes while minimizing infrastructure costs.
