9. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
====================================================================================================

Based on this comprehensive analysis, we recommend:

SHORT-TERM (0-2 years):
  1. Focus on Priority 1 areas with TOD scores >85
  2. Implement express bus services on identified corridors
  3. Improve active transport infrastructure in multimodal areas
  4. Launch pilot programs in top 10 TOD opportunity areas

MEDIUM-TERM (2-5 years):
  5. Develop BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) on highest-volume corridors
  6. Implement hub-and-spoke networks at major employment centers
  7. Zone for higher density near transit stops
  8. Create park-and-ride facilities at key interchange points

LONG-TERM (5-15 years):
  9. Build rail transit in highest-priority corridors
  10. Implement comprehensive TOD policies and zoning reforms
  11. Expand networks to Priority 2 employment center areas
  12. Achieve 30% public transit mode share nationally

POLICY ENABLERS:
  • Transit-oriented zoning reforms
  • Parking pricing and management
  • Complete streets policies
  • Dedicated bus lanes and signal priority
  • Integration of fares and schedules
  • First/last-mile solutions (bike share, microtransit)
