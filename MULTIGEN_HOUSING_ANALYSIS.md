## Methodology

### 1. Generational Overlap Analysis

Measures the presence of multiple generations within an area using age distribution data:

- **Young Children (0-14):** Indicates families with dependent children
- **Parents (35-54):** Prime family formation and earning years
- **Grandparents (55-74):** Active senior generation, capable of multi-gen living
- **Elderly (75+):** Care-requiring generation

**Generational Overlap Score** = Geometric mean of key generational proportions, identifying areas where multiple generations coexist.

### 2. Cultural Community Analysis

Based on birthplace data (G09A-G09H tables), identifies communities with documented multi-generational living preferences:

**High Multi-Gen Cultures (weighted 2x):**
- Asia: China, India, Vietnam, Philippines, Sri Lanka
- Middle East: Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan
- Southern Europe: Greece, Italy, Malta

**Medium Multi-Gen Cultures:**
- Asia: Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand
- Middle East: Egypt, Turkey
- Balkans: Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia
- South America: Chile, Brazil

### 3. Family Composition Analysis

Examines family structures and household patterns:

- **Large Families:** Areas with higher proportions of families with 3+ children
- **Complex Families:** Blended and step-families requiring additional space
- **Household Size:** Multi-person households indicating extended family living

### 4. Housing Stock Analysis

Evaluates current housing configurations:

- **Separate Houses:** Ideal for granny flats and dual occupancy
- **Dwelling Ownership:** High ownership rates indicate viable development market
- **Apartment Concentration:** High-rise areas have limited multi-gen suitability

### 5. Composite Scoring System

**Multi-Gen Demand Score** (0-100):
- Generational Overlap: 35%
- Cultural Propensity: 35%
- Family Size Patterns: 30%

**Supply Gap Score** = Demand Score - Supply Suitability
(High positive values indicate development opportunities)

**Market Opportunity Score:**
- Multi-Gen Demand: 60%
- Ownership Rates: 40%
(Combines demand with market viability)

## Technical Details

### Census Tables Used

| Table | Description | Usage |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| G01 | Age and sex distribution | Generational overlap calculation |
| G09A-H | Birthplace by age groups | Cultural community identification |
| G28 | Number of children born | Family size indicators |
| G31 | Family composition | Complex family analysis |
| G32 | Family income | (Secondary metric) |

### Computational Approach

**Processing:** 2,472 SA2 areas × 8 census tables = ~20,000 data operations

**Normalization:** Percentile ranking (0-100 scale) for cross-metric comparison

**Weighting:** Research-based weights for cultural multi-gen propensities

**Filtering:** Excluded areas with population < 100 for statistical reliability

---

## Limitations & Caveats

1. **Cultural Assumptions:** Multi-gen preferences based on general research; individual preferences vary
2. **Housing Suitability:** Assumes separate houses = granny flat potential; actual zoning varies
3. **Temporal:** 2021 data; housing markets and demographics evolve
4. **Supply Data:** Census doesn't distinguish houses with existing granny flats
5. **Demand Proxy:** Presence of multiple generations ≠ confirmed demand for multi-gen housing

---

## Future Analysis Opportunities

1. **Zoning Overlay:** Integrate planning zones to identify actual development feasibility
2. **Price Analysis:** Combine with property price data for ROI calculations
3. **Temporal Trends:** Compare with 2016 Census to identify emerging markets
4. **Transport Access:** Weight by proximity to employment centers and transit
5. **School Quality:** Family migration patterns influenced by education access
6. **Granular Culturalanalysis:** Specific communities (e.g., Indian subcultures) have varying preferences
