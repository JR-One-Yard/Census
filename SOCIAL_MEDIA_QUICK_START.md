## 💬 Engagement Starters

Use these to boost interaction:

**Questions**:
- "Which finding surprises you most? The employment dominance or regional inequality?"
- "Does this match your experience in your region of Australia?"
- "Should we rethink how we fund local vs regional programs?"

**Controversial takes**:
- "Hot take: Education policy is overrated vs employment policy for reducing inequality. Fight me (with data)."
- "Unpopular opinion: Most local council spending won't move the needle on inequality. It's a regional problem."

**Calls to action**:
- "Share this if you work in public policy 👇"
- "Data scientists: What other questions should we ask with this dataset?"
- "Which Australian region should I analyze in detail next?"
